WHAT IS A GRAPH?
================

- A graph is essentially a visual representation of our models and their relationships.

- TYPES
    - Types are your models/entities.
    - A type has fields that can be tracked.




SETTING UP BABEL
================

- Babel is a JS compiler which allows us to use the latest JS code from ES6.
- Remember when you create a react app? Babel is already installed, but because we're just making a simple node express app, we need to physically install
    babel ourselves so when we use ES6 syntax, babel will compile down to ES5 which is what internet browsers understand.




CREATING A GRAPHQL API
======================

- An important point to note is that graphql is only a specification, not an implementation.
- There the implementation is entirely up to the developer himself.
- Another example of the distinction between between specification and implementation is ECMASCRIPT.
    - ECMASCRIPT is the JS specification. Browser engines like V8 and SpiderMonkey in Chrome and Firefox are
        implementations of those specs.
- GRAPHQL-YOGA is one of these implementations. This implementation provides one of the most advanced feature sets.




GRAPHQL SCALAR TYPES
====================

- A scalar type is just a type that stores a SINGLE value.

- String
- Boolean
- Int
- Float
- Id
